Like, every spoiler. All of them.</strong></p><p>You just finished watching the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie on Netflix, and, if you were smart, you kept watching until the end of the credits and caught that Texas Chainsaw Massacre after credits scene. Now your head is spinning, and you’re wondering, “What does it mean? What does it all mean?”</p><p>Of course, for most of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre run-time—a breezy 83 minutes—it’s really not that deep. Leatherface has a big ol’ chainsaw, and he brutally murders people with it. And, because the 2022 Texas Chainsaw Massacre is considered to be a direct sequel to the 1974 movie, <a href=#>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,</a> that means you don’t even need to have seen the other seven films in the franchise. They are not considered canon, for the purpose of this new movie.</p><p>That said, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre end credits scene may throw you for a loop. Or perhaps you just want to skip ahead and know who survives. Whatever your reason, read on for Decider’s breakdown of the new Texas Chainsaw movie plot summary and the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre ending explained.</p><h2>WHAT IS THE NEW TEXAS CHAINSAW MOVIE ABOUT? TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2022 PLOT SUMMARY:</h2><p>Melody (Sarah Yarkin) is a young businesswoman from San Francisco who has a plan to turn a near-ghost town in rural Texas into a tourist and real estate destination for rich elitists. She drags along her younger sister Lila (<a href=#>Elsie Fisher</a>) to a meeting with potential investors in the town. Lila is recovering from a traumatic shooting at her school, and Melody hopes her sister will join her in Texas so that they can stay together.</p><p>When Melody, Lila, and their friends arrive in Harlow, Texas, they discover something in the town they don’t want their investors to see: a Confederate flag. They try to remove it. They assume the house flying it is abandoned, so they are surprised when an old woman asks what they are doing in her house. The old woman serves her unexpected guests some sweet tea. She tells them the house is an old orphanage that she ran for nearly 50 years. When Melody tentatively informs the old lady that the house has been reclaimed by the bank and that she needs to move out, the old lady gets upset.&nbsp;While the old lady is panicking, a menacing figure appears in the stairwell. We don’t see his face. The old woman tells the man to go back to his room, that she is fine.</p><p>“He’s the last of my boys,” she tells Melody. “He needs special care. He doesn’t do well outside, that’s why I can’t be here.” The police come to remove the old woman from the property, and she collapses in fear. The same looming figure from before scoops her up and puts her in the police car, to take her to the hospital. One of Melody’s friends, played by Jessica Allain, offers to ride with them to the hospital, so that she can let Melody know the woman is OK. As they drive away, Lila gets a chilling glace at the looming figure’s face in shadow, and she sees only an eye.</p><p>As you may have guessed, that looming figure is none other than Leatherface (played by Mark Burnham), aka the chainsaw-wielding murderer who was first played by Gunnar Hansen in the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. When the orphanage lady dies on the way to the hospital, Leatherface goes on a murderous rampage, killing everyone in the truck with his chainsaw.</p><p>Most of the rest of the movie follows Leatherface as he attempts to hunt down Melody, whom he clearly blames for the death of his surrogate mother figure. The only survivor from Leatherface’s murderous rampage 50 years ago, a woman named Sally Hardesty (previously played by Marilyn Burns, now played by Olwen Fouéré) gets word that Leatherface is back. She comes to Harlow with weapons, hoping to defeat him for good.</p><p>Leatherface cuts up a lot of people with his chainsaw, and soon only Melody and Lila are left of their friends. Sally shows up at just the right moment with her van, but instead of driving away, Sally insists they have to stay until Sally can kill Leatherface. Unfortunately, Leatherface gets the better of Sally, and she is left nearly dead in the street. Leatherface pursues Melody and Lila. They try to hit him with the van, but crash. Melody is trapped in the van and tells Lila to run and leave her behind. Lila does—but then comes back and tries to shoot Leatherface. She’s out of ammo, but luckily, Sally appears and uses the last of her strength to shoot Leatherface in the shoulder.</p><figure id=attachment_1067870 class="wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"><span class=credit>Photo: Yana Blajeva / Legendary, Courtesy of Netflix</span></figure><h2>WHAT IS THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ENDING EXPLAINED?</h2><p>A dying Sally tells Lila not to run—”If you run, he’ll never stop haunting you,”—so instead of helping her sister and getting the heck out of there, Lila follows Leatherface into the abandoned theater, armed with a rifle. For some reason, there is a pool of water in this theater, and Leatherface tackles Lila and nearly drowns her. Eventually, Lila pulls herself out of the water, but Leatherface gets the better of her. He’s about to chop her up with his chainsaw when her sister, Melody, comes out of nowhere and jumps on him.</p><p>Lila shoots Leatherface in the stomach with her last bullet. Then Melody picks up the chainsaw and cuts him up the middle—but it’s a fairly shallow cut. Leatherface falls into the water. At first, we see bubbles that show he is still breathing, but eventually, the bubbles stop, suggesting that he is dead. Is Leatherface finally gone, once and for all?</p><p>Nope! In the film’s final scene, Lila and Mel get into their fancy car and turn on autopilot mode. Just as the car starts to pull away, Leatherface suddenly appears and grabs Mel through the passenger window. He beheads her in the street with his chainsaw, while Lila screams from the car that is still driving away on autopilot.</p><h2>IS THERE A TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE AFTER CREDITS SCENES?</h2><p>Yes. If you wait until the very end of the credits, you’ll get a bonus scene of Leatherface limping down a dirt road with his chainsaw, toward a quaint little farmhouse with a windmill.</p><h2>TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE POST CREDITS SCENE EXPLAINED:</h2><p>Leatherface is headed toward a house that true Texas Chainsaw fans might recognize: It’s Leatherface’s house where he lived with his brother, aka the early 1900s farmhouse where the first 1974 movie, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was filmed.</p><figure id=attachment_1075318 class="wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"><span class=credit>Photo: Netflix, Everett Collection</span></figure><p>In the original film, Leatherface lived in that house with his brother and their grandpa. Leatherface’s brother was supposedly killed in the first movie. While he did come back in future movies, along with other members of Leatherface’s family, it’s important to remember that the 2022 Texas Chainsaw Massacre was intended as a direct sequel to the 1974 film, and the filmmakers don’t consider the other movies to be canon.</p><p>Still, you know how things are in slashers—no one ever really dies.</p><p>Does this mean there will be more Texas Chainsaw movies, and that Leatherface will reunite with his brother? We’ll have to wait and see to find out.</p><p><a href=# class=article-list__stream-link data-ga-event='{"category":"Stream On: Default","action":"https:\/\/decider.com\/2022\/02\/18\/texas-chainsaw-massacre-ending-explained-post-credit-scene-house\/","label":"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/title\/81483977"}' rel=noopener>Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre on Netflix<br></a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJrFor%2BMnJ%2BaoZ6orrh5zJqqrJmTp7Jusc2doKefXZrFsbjAoqWenF2dvLh506GcZqifqMFur9Gem6KsXaiwprrEZpqopp6asLW%2FjK2mZqyYmnqwvsigoKeZnGKzqrjMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
