According to the latest reports, the reality star and her troubled boyfriend are living out of Alabama hotel rooms since Geno Doak has been ordered to stay away from the mother.</p><p>June and Geno were arrested for the possession of crack cocaine and domestic violence after the police were called on them while they were having a domestic dispute. Witnesses claim that Doak was threatening to kill his girlfriend at a gas station.</p><p>Geno was court ordered to stay away from the ‘From Not to Hot’ star but clearly violated that order since they were spotted together at a casino shortly after their release.</p><p>Shannon tried to get the courts to allow Geno to be near her stating that he is a great help to her daily life due to the fact that she is legally blind in one eye. The request was to no avail.</p><p>Mama June’s family wants her to kick the felon to the curb. The Hollywood Gossip revealed Doak’s long criminal history dating back to 1996.</p><p>A portion of the report reads: “Court documents state that Doak entered a building with “intent to commit a theft” in February of 1996 He was arrested days later back then and charged with felony burglary, eventually pleading guilty to the burglary charge and being sentenced to three years in prison. In March 2009, Geno was taken into custody after he allegedly stole a $500 cargo trailer belonging to The Griffin First United Methodist Church in Griffin, Georgia.”</p><p>It went on to say that Geno was also admitted to the hospital a decade ago for attempting to commit suicide for the third time. He was arrested many times after for theft charges.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>June can’t seem to quit Geno although it is very clear that they’re in a toxic relationship.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGedlrqiecmupZ5lkaOxbrPEp6ZmnJ%2BWuG6ty6WcoJ2UocZuuMivoKefXaTCtXnOn2Shp6SauW6%2BzqikrGWZo3qiuMCbmKaZXZyyr7vSZpqroZ2eu6K4jKGgrKyfp8ZuvsSvnJqklZl6c4OUb25rZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
