The club’s great’s career came to an end in the 2021–22 campaign.</p><p>In honour of the 40-year-final old’s NFL season, a farewell tour was organised. In a video he posted on social media, Roethlisberger made clear what has become apparent in the final days of the 2021 campaign.</p><p>“The journey has been incredible, fueled by a competitive spirit. The moment has come, though, to organise my locker, hang up my cleats, and continue to give my wife and children everything I’ve got. I sincerely thank you for a great football game.”</p><p>The two-time Super Bowl champion Roethlisberger had been planning his retirement for the most of the year. But the Steelers’ season came to an end in January when they were severely trounced by the Chiefs in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs.</p><p>In the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft, the team selected Ohio’s Miami University’s Ben Roethlisberger. He was selected in the same year’s top quarterback class as Eli Manning and Philip Rivers.</p><h3>Ben Roethlisberger’s records</h3><p>Ben Roethlisberger, who has 165 victories overall with the Steelers, has won more games with one team than any other player except Tom Brady (219 with the New England Patriots). Since at least 1950, this statistic places a quarterback in sixth place for most victories.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger has participated in 249 regular-season games during the Steelers’ history, which is the most by any player. With a 165-81-1 record, he had the fifth-most regular-season victories in NFL history.</p><p>Roethlisberger is eighth all-time in passing yards with 64,088, and he is seventh in touchdown passes with 418.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger holds the all-time records for passing touchdowns, home triumphs, and quarterback victories for the Steelers. Roethlisberger will be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2027, according to the organisation.</p><p>In the 2004 NFL Draft, Roethlisberger was taken No. 11 overall out of Miami, behind fellow sturdy quarterbacks Eli Manning and Philip Rivers. Due to injuries, he was thrust into the action early and made his NFL debut in the third game as a rookie.</p><p>He was able to win all 13 games while serving as the starting quarterback that season, earning Offensive Rookie of the Year while leading Pittsburgh to a 15-1 record before falling short in the AFC Championship game.</p><p>Furthermore, as a starter, he had a regular-season win rate of.670, the second-highest in the history of the team and the sixth-highest in NFL history.</p><p>Roethlisberger’s final season wasn’t as successful as he’d hoped, but the Steelers were still able to make the playoffs despite a 1-3 start and a three-game losing streak in the middle of the season. In his final season, he threw for 3,740 yards, 22 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="ben roethlisberger latest news,ben roethlisberger wife,ben roethlisberger net worth,ben roethlisberger rings,is ben roethlisberger married,how old is ben roethlisberger,ben roethlisberger podcast,ben roethlisberger retire,ben roethlisberger family,ben roethlisberger 40 time now,ben roethlisberger then and now,what is ben roethlisberger doing now that he's retired,what's ben roethlisberger going to do now,what will ben roethlisberger do now,ben roethlisberger job now,ben roethlisberger facts,has ben roethlisberger retired,where is ben roethlisberger now,ben roethlisberger number" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
