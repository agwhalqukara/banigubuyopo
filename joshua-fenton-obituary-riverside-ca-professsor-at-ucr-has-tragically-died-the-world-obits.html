In a spontaneous act of unity, we reorganized our space to accommodate others, shared meals unexpectedly, and engaged in conversations that mingled our joys, sorrows, and the weight of the grading awaiting our attention. The weather mirrored our sentiments—little sun for umbrellas to shield us, but we found the light in one another.</p><p>The unexpected loss of Joshua Fenton, a cherished member of our writing department, has cast a shadow of grief over our collective spirits. His passing, following a valiant struggle against a health emergency, stands as a poignant reminder of life’s fragility—a reminder that amidst our illusions of invincibility, there exists an undeniable reality of vulnerability.</p><p>Yet, amidst this existential apprehension, love emerges as an unrivaled force—a force that transcends technological marvels or artistic creations. Joshua, or Josh as we fondly remember him, embodied authenticity. His infectious laughter, keen insights into writing and teaching, and his unwavering support as a union worker were testaments to his genuine character.</p><p>The analogy of cosplaying fright nights and horror pales in comparison to the stark reality that life’s beauty, while vibrant and precious, cannot endure indefinitely. It’s a stark awakening to the haunting realization that uncertainties loom even in our most ordinary moments—the uncertainty of a mundane walk to the car, a routine plane journey, or the betrayal of our bodies.</p><p>This shared illumination, born of compassion, camaraderie, and mutual support, signifies that even amidst the darkest of times, the radiance from our connections will continue to illuminate our path forward. In the face of loss, we discovered that our greatest strength lies in our unity, empathy, and the resilience we derive from each other’s presence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5qkwKnBwGadnqakpLtuu8Giq66Zoq56s7XVnqmsoZSaeqStjKmpqJ6VqMC0u9FmmK1lpZi%2FbrTArGStqpGctqSty6WwZpyZmrFuwMeeZLCnoqGxbrvBoqusZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
