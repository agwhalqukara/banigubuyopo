We are only just uncovering one of the largest structures on the site,” said lead archaeologist Alfredo Barrera Rubio.</p><p>As work continues at the site, researchers will attempt to preserve and restore the structure as best they can. But for now, this stunning site is off limits to the public. Though one thing we do know for now is that the architectural details on the palace were likely designed to make the building resemble a giant snake.</p><p>See more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2>1,200-Year-Old Piggy Bank With Gold Inside Found In Israel</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-257142 alt="Gold Coins From Ancient Piggy Bank" width=900 height=507 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/gold-coins-from-ancient-piggy-bank.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-257142 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Liat Nadav-Ziv, Israel Antiquities Authority</span><span class=caption-body>The gold coins and small piece of pottery in which they were found.</span></p><p>During the last week of December, as Hanukkah was concluding, researchers in Yavne Israel found an ancient “piggy bank” complete with “Hannukah gelt.”</p><p>The small piece of pottery dating to about 1,200 years ago indeed contained seven gold coins. The entire find was made at the site of what was then a pottery production facility that included a number of kilns.</p><p>Researchers working at the site have made other finds including a wine-making facility and a number of other ceramics. However, the “piggy bank” believed to contain the personal coin stash of a potter who worked at the site has understandably attracted much of the attention thus far.</p><p>Dig deeper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1tMisZLCdlaB6qrqMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm66xLCqZpyVmHpzhYyjmKdlZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
