He landed on his right arm while being sacked by Vikings defensive end Danielle Hunter on the team's first drive of the third quarter and was ruled out with a thumb injury shortly after.</p><p>The 24-year-old has been sidelined since, missing a win over the Las Vegas Raiders and losses to the Los Angeles Chargers and New Orleans Saints.</p><p>Even when Fields was healthy this season, the Bears' offense was lackluster.
