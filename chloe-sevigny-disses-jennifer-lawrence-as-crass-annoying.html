But <strong>Chloe Sevigny</strong>, for one, is over it.</p><p>The Bloodline actress, 40, made her feelings clear in an interview for <a href=#>V Magazine</a>'s Spring issue. Asked whether she worries about being typecast, she admitted she's "afraid that maybe people think there's more personality than acting ability."</p><p>As writer Natasha Stagg pointed out, however, a big personality is a big part of being a celebrity, at least in the current culture.</p><p>"So much is about marketing and selling the product," Sevigny agreed. "They'll have a really peppy funny girl on the talk show rounds, and everybody adores her and loves her and wants to be her or fâ€“k her, and then so many more people want to watch the movie or TV show. I understand that star quality, how much value that carries."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: "I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think <strong><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a></strong> is a great movie star. I don't think I can be that, or just be an actor. I don't think I have the charisma. Which is probably why I never reached another level."</p><p>Jolie isn't the only actress she admires, though. "I like <strong><a href=#>Emma Stone</a></strong>. Whenever she's herself, she's really cute," the American Horror Story: Asylum alum told V of the Birdman Oscar nominee.</p><p>Not so cute? "Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying," Sevigny shared of the Hunger Games star and Oscar winner. "Too crass."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhpJ%2BaerSx1aKep7Fdmba0v8SsZKOdnqO2p7HRZqOar6Kau6SxjJqqZpmeo7y6tc2gZJyqkajAbn6PamxqaGM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
