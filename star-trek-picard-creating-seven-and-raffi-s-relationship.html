The honeymoon phase is past, though we do learn about some of that in the<strong> No Man’s Land</strong> audio drama (which also casually confirms both characters have been attracted to men and women).</p><p>“You’re bickering and you’re on each other’s nerves sometimes,” explains Ryan, “but you love each other, you respect each other.”</p><p>The relationship between the two was easy to flesh out, according to Hurd, because the two actresses thought the same way and clicked immediately when they began working together in season one.</p><p>“The producers saw that and knew that there was something that they could build on,” remembers Hurd. “I trust her. I know that if I decide to do a line in a different way, (Ryan) is gonna pick it up and hit it back to me and we’re going to have a real moment.”</p><p>One of the many great things about the edge in the Seven/Raffi relationship is that while the show never forgets the two are a couple, it also allows them to carry on their own plotlines. As Ryan says, “These are two very independent, mature, driven, socially inept, stubborn, pigheaded, and strong willed women who have fully realized lives. They’re trying to figure out how you navigate a relationship while trying to save the entire galaxy.”</p><p><strong>Star Trek: Picard </strong>season 2 is set to give us even more sides to this relationship and we can’t wait for it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOrKuaql2pv6a3jKmgnJmimXqkvsSaq6Kml2LApsLEp2SappRiv6KyxaKqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
