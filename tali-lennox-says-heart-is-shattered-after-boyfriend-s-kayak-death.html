"The autopsy has revealed no injuries or trauma to Mr. Jones’ body, and the findings are consistent with drowning," Capt. Watterson tells <strong>Us</strong> in a statement. "There were no signs of criminal conduct or foul play found, and toxicology tests were performed however the results of those tests won’t be known for several weeks. The search for Mr. Jones has now officially ended, and at this time his death is considered to be an accidental drowning with no criminal charges expected."</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong>Absolutely heartbreaking. <strong>Annie Lennox's </strong>daughter <strong>Tali Lennox-Fruchtmann </strong>paid tribute to her late boyfriend<strong> Ian Jones </strong>via Instagram on Monday, Aug. 10. Authorities recently told <strong>Us Weekly</strong> that Jones' <a href=#>body was possibly found</a> after the couple's kayaking accident in the Hudson River.</p><p>"My heart is shattered. My best friend, my soul mate, my partner in crime & creativity, the LOVE & LIGHT of my life is no longer with me," Lennox-Fruchtmann, 22, captioned a black-and-white photo of the two.</p><p>"All the love that has been sent to me is giving me the strength to get through this. I know that he is so so happy that I was safely rescued," she continued. "Let us honor & celebrate this beautiful soul & keep following the light."</p><p>As previously reported, Lennox-Fruchtmann and Jones' kayak capsized in upstate New York on Saturday. Annie's daughter was rescued by another boat 20 minutes after the accident, while Jones' body was possibly found near the Poughkeepsie Yacht Club Monday.</p><p>"The body matches the description of Mr. Ian Jones," officials told Us Weekly, noting that it's a "strong possibility" that they found Jones.</p><p>Tali's famous mother, meanwhile, has yet to comment on the tragedy. Annie had Tali with her second ex-husband, <strong>Uri Fruchtmann</strong>. The exes are also parents to daughter <strong>Lola</strong>, 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuapJliuaa6zaivZquRrsButMSaqa1lmah6tLTAraueqpWZeqKy056pZpqfrrOztcSnm6xlm5bGoreMnZyarJhif3F9lGpocQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
