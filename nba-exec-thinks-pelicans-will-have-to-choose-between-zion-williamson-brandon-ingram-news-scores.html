"I think that happens this summer."</p><p>Williamson, Ingram and C.J. McCollum are all earning more than $33 million per season, and players like Herb Jones, Trey Murphy III and Jordan Hawkins will be among those due for extensions in the future.</p><p>If the Pelicans want to retain those players and avoid the luxury tax, it's no surprise Williamson or Ingram could be made available for trade.</p><p>While both players are talented, it's worth wondering how the Pelicans feel about Williamson's future in the Big Easy, in particular, given his injury history.</p><p>The Duke product has never played a full season and continues to have issues staying on the court. The most games he has played in a year came in 2020-21 when he appeared in 61 games and earned his first career All-Star selection.</p><p>There have also been concerns within the organization about Williamson's conditioning.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Christian Clark</a> of <i>The Times-Picayune </i>reported in December that the Pelicans "have repeatedly stressed to Williamson that his diet and conditioning need to improve," but the 2019 first overall pick "doesn't listen."</p><p>New Orleans will have to weigh those concerns with how he has performed when healthy and decide if his performance, even when limited, is worth more to the team than losing him entirely.</p><p>It's also important to note that Williamson is just 23 years old and has a lengthy career ahead of him.</p><p>Through 43 games this season, Williamson is averaging 22.1 points, 5.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists while shooting 58.1 percent from the floor and 36.4 percent from deep.</p><p>Ingram, 26, also hasn't played more than 62 games for the Pelicans since arriving in New Orleans in 2019. However, he has been on the court far more than Williamson and continues to be a valuable asset for the team.</p><p>Through 50 games this year, Ingram is averaging 21.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists while shooting 49.1 percent from the floor and 35.7 percent from deep.</p><p>Deciding between Williamson and Ingram would be tough for the Pelicans, and a decision could eventually come down to what assets they could receive in exchange for each player.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYG6BdH6Mp5maZZWtsqR506Ggp6OjYr2muMicmKerXay2rbiMoZivnV2pvG6vx6imrJ1dl7K1w8SepWaymaS7bsPIpaOimZ2ovK95wauYp5yfo3qqusarmKY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
