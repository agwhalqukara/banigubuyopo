A Wonderful Day to Be a Dog</h2><p>Cha Eun-woo was cast as the main character in the webtoon version of A Good Day to Be a Dog, according to South Korean news portal TV Daily on August 15.&nbsp;In reaction to the news, a source at his agency, Fantagio, said that no such confirmation has yet been made. The celebrity is now assessing many projects, one of them is the Naver webtoon adaption.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cha-Eun-Woo-1-1.jpg alt="Cha Eun Woo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While an official confirmation may take some time, it won’t be surprising if the singer gives the project an okay. He has gained international acclaim for his portrayals as the boy-next-door and romantic protagonist in a number of Korean dramas. True Beauty, My ID is Gangnam Beauty, and Rookie Historian Goo Hae-ryung have all been popular rom-com in recent years. Lee Hey produced the webtoon A Good Day to be a Dog in 2018, featuring elements of romance and humor, as well as some fantasy sprinkled in. Hana Han, the female protagonist character, is a school teacher who, despite her professional success, fails to satisfy her personal aspirations. She is cursed by an ancestor to transform into a dog every midnight if she kisses a man. While she does change back into a human the following morning, the transformation link is broken when she kisses the same person as a dog.</p><p>Because the curse is such a hindrance, none of her love relationships have survived. One day, she has a mishap when she kisses Jin Seo-won while inebriated. The greater issue arises when it is revealed that he is scared of dogs, and as a result, Hana’s efforts to reverse the curse by gaining a kiss as a dog are faced with unanticipated difficulties.&nbsp;Because the narrative features many lighthearted elements, Cha Eun-woo seems to be interested in taking on the project.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cha-Eun-woo-2.jpg alt="Cha Eun-woo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More projects under consideration by Cha Eun-woo</h2><p>Furthermore, Sports Chosun stated that the idol is in discussions to play the lead in another romantic-fantasy drama, This Relationship is Uncontrollable.
