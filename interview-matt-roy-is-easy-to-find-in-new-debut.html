The vocals and production seem to be pretty raw in my eyes, so we recorded it live in the studio without overproducing and editing it.”</p><p>Roy, a signed writer to BMG, says he has been fortunate enough to have had songs cut by other artists, which have found their place on the radio. “The most exciting part for me has been watching how your music can affect people,” he explains. “It’s been amazing to see people live their life jamming to these tracks.”</p><p>However, the biggest challenge according to the recording artist has been writing songs that stick out in the crowd.</p><p>“There are so many singers, artists, and songwriters today that all play and post at the same time, which makes it difficult to stay up-to-date with the industry.”</p><p>Indeed the transformation of the industry has impacted many artists’ abilities to write, produce, and perform thanks to platforms such as TikTok and Instagram becoming more prevalent for discovery.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think these platforms have opened the door for more people to be heard. I remember as a kid, having to go around town and hang fliers in mom and pop’s, and emailing people that I was playing somewhere. Now, you have an entire world of people you can reach at your fingertips.”</p><p>As an artist and writer, Roy believes that injecting himself into every song is crucial. “Whether I am writing a song for myself or somebody else, I try to put my fingerprints on that song through lyrics, melody, and/or production.”</p><p>Roy attributes his passion for music to industry icons including Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Eddie Vedder, which he says he aligns closely with because of his ability to write truthfully and demonstrate vulnerability. “Their lyric writing is second to none,” he says. “I also loved how they weren’t afraid to change, even with their success. Their albums have progressed and evolved over time, and that’s what I hope to accomplish.”</p><p>You can listen to Roy’s latest song “Easy to Find” on all music streaming platforms.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktq%2FAxKutop2nYrqiwNNmqaixXZ7AbrHArLBmrJ9is6q6w2agp2WemsRusMSbrK1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
