"We do it for just the opportunity to be on the field in that environment, and really consider it a privilege to be there."</p><p>It's unclear what the long-term outlook for chain gang crews in the NFL is going to be. CBS Sports' <a href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Jones</a> reported last month the league will use the 2024 preseason to <a href=# rel=noopener>test an optical tracking system</a> that can electronically measure first downs.</p><p>If the testing goes well and the system gets approved by people within the NFL, it will be implemented for the regular season.</p><p>Jones did note chain gangs wouldn't necessarily go away entirely if the new system is approved, but they would be used "as a backup for game operations and as a reference point for coaches, players and fans in the stadium."</p><p>The NFL doesn't consider referees or the chain gang crew to be full-time employees. The website <a href=# rel=noopener>FootballZebras.com</a>, which tracks officiating crews every season, provided a list of full-time jobs referees have based on the information available.</p><p>Titles range from non-profit CEO (Brad Allen), business development (Andrew Lambert) and aerospace software engineer (Adrian Hill) to a retired teacher (Tom Hill) and retired air traffic controller (Kevin Brown).</p><p>In November 2020, <a href=# rel=noopener>Alex Prewitt</a> of <i>Sports Illustrated </i>noted the majority of chain gang crews were paid $75 to $100 per game. The New York Jets were on the high end of payout for their crew at $150 per game.</p><p>Prewitt also noted some teams, like the Washington Commanders, compensated their crew chief with season tickets. It's unclear if that's on top of a per-game payout or instead of a financial payout.</p><p>Referees do have a union, and their pay is governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the NFL Referees Association and the NFL. The current CBA, which was <a href=# rel=noopener>ratified</a> in September 2019, runs through the 2025 season.</p><p>Financial details of the new CBA weren't specified in the agreement, but <a href=# rel=noopener>Ben Austro</a> of FootballZebras.com noted officials were earning on average $205,000 per season for the 2019 season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmiEenyMq5ypp6Kpeq%2Byy2apnp6jYrKivs1mmKxlnaqwqXnArGRraGCgeqKt1Wamp2WTpLu1vsCcq6xlk52uqrqMoJinn12Yv6bDjKagp6Gdqrpuw8CgnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
