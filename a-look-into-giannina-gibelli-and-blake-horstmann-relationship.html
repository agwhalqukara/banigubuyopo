On Sunday, November 20, Blake remarked in an Instagram video:</p><p>“All right, so I’m going to surprise G this morning and formally ask her to move in with me.”</p><p>All-Star Beach Blake wrote “Will You Move In With Me?” in the snow and expected Giannina to respond by building a snow angel in the yard. Giannina ultimately agreed, sealing the transaction with a kiss.</p><h2>Blake Horstmann and Giannina Gibelli met on All-Star Shore.</h2><p>Giannina Gibelli and Blake Horstmann originally met while shooting All-Star Shore for Paramount+. Until All Star Shore premiered earlier this year, the pair had to keep their affair under wraps. Blake explained to Us Weekly:</p><p>“We had to keep our relationship hidden for the first six months, which was enjoyable in a way because we didn’t have the public pressure, we didn’t have all eyes on us, and we could just be ourselves.” But it was also difficult since hiding the person you love is never enjoyable.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Giannina-Gibelli-1.jpg alt="Giannina Gibelli" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also said that despite having been in the “public glare for four years,” this was the “first time” he had “dated anybody in public.”&nbsp;Blake came to prominence as a suitor on Becca Kufrin’s season 14 of The Bachelorette. While he was sent home in the finale, the 32-year-old went on to star in back-to-back seasons of Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>Blake came under criticism during Bachelor in Paradise season 6 for his pre-show hookups with Kristina Schulman and Caelynn Miller-Keyes after finishing as the runner-up in the 2018 season.&nbsp;Blake turned to Instagram during the 2019 season to show his text chats with Caelynn. In 2021, he told Us Weekly’s Here for the Right Reasons podcast about the drama:</p><p>“I have no regrets. That is something I will never apologize for. I’ll never be sorry or apologize for protecting myself.”</p><p>Giannina, for her part, got engaged to Damian Powers during the first season of Love Is Blind. Despite Damian canceling their wedding at the finale, they continued to date on and off until 2021.&nbsp;Damian and Francesca Farago divorced in August 2021 after Damian was suspected of cheating on her with Too Hot to Handle Francesca Farago. Damian, on the other hand, disputed the charges. Giannina told Entertainment Tonight at the time about her break-up:</p><p>“I haven’t been dating Damian for a few months now. I’ve progressed. I’m feeling fantastic. “I’m absolutely at a great spot in my life.”</p><p>Gibelli and Blake began dating while shooting All Star Shore, but had to keep their relationship a secret until the show’s debut. Gibelli ultimately made her connection with Blake public in June, once the news of All Star Shore became known. She said to E! News:</p><p>“I’d never seen the Bachelor series or anything like that, so I had no idea who he was.” He seemed familiar to me, and he just smiled at me, and that’s how I met him there on the beach.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Giannina-Gibelli-2.jpg alt="Giannina Gibelli" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Blake disclosed during a July 13 session on the How Men Think podcast about his friendship with Gibelli:</p><p>“Fortunately, I met Giannina quite fast, and we hit it off straight away, and I’m so delighted we did… Right now, I’m overjoyed.”</p><p>The All Star Shore pair, on the other hand, took things slowly at first owing to previous relationships, but they are still going strong and plan to do so in the future.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYZqSfpLhutc2tpmafmZa7r7XNmmSgoZKaua21jJqlnWWSoa6ssYyhpqurpKKur7qMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
