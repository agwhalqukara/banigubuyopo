That time is one of post-war recovery when the Government, keen to rebuild quickly after devastating bombing raids by the Nazi Luftwaffe, would turn to temporary homes in a bid to solve the country’s housing crisis.
More than 156,000 ‘prefab’ homes – flat-pack properties constructed in a factory out of a limited number of materials – were built across Britain on the orders of Winston Churchill, who had envisaged the problem even before the end of the Second World War. <a href=../../the-prefab-homes-still-standing-in-moseley-how-temporary-tin-can-homes-became-a-local-landmark.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../tragic-details-about-foreigner-247-news-around-the-world.html>Tragic Details About Foreigner - 247 News Around The World</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Post-op, his treatment included the use of steroids — and that, in turn, meant he gained around 100 pounds.
Fans did, of course, notice, and he was candid about the bullying: “I didn’t feel good or look good, and I took a tremendous backlash from fans who thought I was eating too much when it was the steroids that were blowing me up,” he explained. <a href=../../tragic-details-about-foreigner-247-news-around-the-world.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../chris-brown-calls-out-kiely-williams-points-out-blueface-chrisean-rock-double-standard.html>Chris Brown Calls Out Kiely Williams, Points Out Blueface &amp;amp; Chrisean Rock Double Standard</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Brown and Bailey on Wednesday shared that they were collaborating on a song, “How Does It Feel,” to be the second track on her upcoming debut album, but her fans appeared to be outraged that she was collaborating with Brown. Many felt that Brown, who pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna more than a decade ago, is not the best person for Bailey to align herself with. <a href=../../chris-brown-calls-out-kiely-williams-points-out-blueface-chrisean-rock-double-standard.html>Read More...</a></section></article></div><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../page/56/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
