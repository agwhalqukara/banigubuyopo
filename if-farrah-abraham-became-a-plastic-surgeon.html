According to Farrah, the last several years has taught her that she can achieve anything she wants, and she believes that plastic surgery is her calling. &nbsp;During an interview with E!, Farrah&nbsp;stated: ”&nbsp;I really want to&nbsp;get my doctorate and I want to do plastic surgery. So that’s just something on top of all of the other things I want to do but that would probably be my end goal.” &nbsp;While many were immediately skeptical of her latest scheme, Farrah seems to be entirely serious. &nbsp;Although the chances of her actually becoming a plastic surgeon are slim to none, the idea itself certainly raises a lot of interesting thoughts. &nbsp;Here are five things that would happen if Farrah Abraham became a plastic surgeon.</p><h2>5. Farrah Abraham would probably try to be her own patient.</h2><p>Over the years Farrah has proven to be extremely self-centered. &nbsp;Her own track record with plastic surgery proves that she certainly isn’t above altering her appearance. &nbsp;If Farrah were allowed to perform plastic surgery on anyone, there’s a good chance she would probably try to perform some sort of procedure on herself.</p><h2>4. Farrah Abraham would probably make&nbsp;her daughter a patient.</h2><p>In 2013, Farrah made headlines when she revealed that she had waxed her four-year old daughter’s eyebrows. &nbsp;While there’s no denying that Farrah’s daughter is an absolutely adorable little girl, there’s also no denying that Farrah can be downright crazy. &nbsp;It’s not hard to imagine plastic surgeon Farrah performing a minor procedure on her daughter, and then trying to rationalize it as a way to boost the young girl’s&nbsp;self image.</p><h2>3. Farrah Abraham would write a tell-all book.</h2><p>Since becoming a reality TV star, Farrah has proven that she’s willing to do almost anything to make a buck. &nbsp;With that being said, doctor patient confidentiality is likely to go out of the window if Farrah feels like there’s money to be made by writing a tell-all book about her patients.</p><h2>2. Farrah Abraham would get her own reality TV series.</h2><p>Watching Farah on Teen Mom is pretty entertaining, but a show following&nbsp;her work as a plastic surgeon would definitely take the cake.</p><h2>1.&nbsp;The number of plastic surgery mishaps would certainly rise.</h2><p>Unfortunately, botched plastic surgery procedures happen relatively often. &nbsp;However, with Farrah in charge of the operating room, the changes of plastic surgery mishaps definitely seems likely to increase.</p><p>(Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidmqqilrVurcGrmKGZnWKvpq%2FAppxmqJyWwLW1wmaqrqqXmryvew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
