Whereas he's due to collect <a href=# rel=noopener>$13.6 million</a> in cash, he may try to bump that up to $15 million or $16 million.</p><p>Two things are working against the 28-year-old, though.</p><p>Sutton is signed through the 2025 season, so Denver doesn't face an imminent threat of him leaving next offseason or plausibly continuing a holdout into Week 1 this year. His performance hasn't provided a compelling reason for the team to be aggressive in negotiations, either.</p><p>The 6'4" pass-catcher hasn't been the same player since suffering a torn ACL in 2020. From 2021 on, he has 181 receptions for 2,377 yards and 14 touchdowns in 48 appearances. That averages out to 64 receptions and 842 over a 17-game season.</p>Bleacher Report <span class=acct>@BleacherReport</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>COURTLAND SUTTON ARE YOU KIDDING?! ðŸ˜± &lt;br>&lt;br>(via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NFL&lt;/a>) &lt;br> &lt;a href="https://t.co/N8qMHJHR3q">pic.twitter.com/N8qMHJHR3q&lt;/a></p><p>For now, Sutton will occupy a key role in the passing game. Josh Reynolds is the biggest veteran addition to the receiving corps and the team waited until the third day of the NFL draft to address the position, selecting Oregon's Troy Franklin and Utah's Devaughn Vele.</p><p>The Broncos front office may nonetheless feel comfortable about letting Sutton play out 2024 on his current salary before weighing up all of its options next spring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaCdYSMp52lZaKqurC%2B0maaqK2iqbmiusNmqq6spKS7bq7RqKWcp6NitaLCxKerZqWRmbJuvsSao2aooqS0s7HSrGSopl2YvK%2FA0ZqarWWklrmsvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
