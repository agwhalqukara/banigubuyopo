Just after he’s been sentenced to about four years in federal prison, he has been hit with two more weapon charges that could cost him even more time.</p><p>The Shade Room cited the info from Miami Herald and reported that ‘the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s office formally charged Kodak with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon today.’</p><p>TSR continued and said that ‘If convicted on these new charges, Kodak could serve up to 30 years in prison on each count as a “habitual violent offender.”’</p><p>It’s been also revealed that according to court documents, prosecutors filed one count for a gun purchased by Kodak in January as you can see in TSR’s post below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B46GtYRhIfb/</p><p>Someone commented: ‘Just leave him alone damn the entire world our to get him.’</p><p>Another follower said: ‘😂 rappers be having millions but won’t pay a couple hundred on a gun license lmaooo!!’</p><p>Someone posted: ‘When all he had to do,… was stay away from guns??!!!! How tha fk hard is that for real????’</p><p>One other follower wrote: ’30 years in prison for gun charges but amber guyger serves 10 years for LEGIT WALKING INTO A STRANGERS HOME. SHOOTING & KILLING HIM? White privilege is REAL.’</p><p>A person said: ‘That’s Strong, but he should’ve respected his freedom 🤷🏾‍♀️ minded his business and made his music.’</p><p>Not too long ago, <a href=#>attorney Lee Pearlman chatted with HollywoodLife</a>, revealing that the rapper has few chances to be released earlier on.</p><p>Pearlman explained that the 46 months he will have to remain in prison is ‘a reasonable amount’ of time.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But since then, as you read above, two more charges came along. Stay tuned for more info about Kodak’s case.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebpLGit4ybo5qbm2K0psDSZpmanF2jsri%2FjK2uqGWdpL%2BmecaupWabmJa%2FqLHSZpqorZyZeq6xwKdkbGhdrrKivtJmoKdlmpa2rXnEmpqhZWNpfnZ8j2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
