"Sofia and Joe were completely making out at the table, very touchy-feely the whole time," the eyewitness tells <strong>Us</strong>, adding, "Sofia was talking [a lot] and was very animated."</p><p>The actors—<strong>Us</strong> <a href=#>exclusively revealed</a> their new romance earlier this month—left "hand in hand" to then catch Gaga's #artRAVE tour. Vergara was equally as into seeing the "Gypsy" singer perform as she was her boyfriend.</p><p>Taking to her Instagram, the Modern Family actress jokingly teased her son <strong>Manolo</strong>, posting a picture of her VIP access with the <a href=#>caption</a>: "@Manologonzalezvergara dont be jelooooous."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vergara, who kept close to her True Blood beau, 37, while at the concert, also shared a selfie of herself and the Mother Monster. "Gracias JM gracias NM Sorry Manolo," she <a href=#>captioned</a> the pic, apologizing to her son who missed out and sending her thanks to Joe and Nick, who got the initial invite from Gaga to attend the show.</p><p>A source close to the hunk tells <strong>Us</strong> Joe and Nick met Gaga's mom, <strong>Cynthia</strong>, when she attended their La Bare screening at Soho House in New York City with chef <strong>Art Smith</strong> last month. The source adds the brothers then dined at Gaga's parents restaurant Joanne Trattoria in the Big Apple.&nbsp;</p><p>An insider close to Vergara <a href=#>tells <strong>Us</strong></a> the couple are "very hot and heavy," adding, "she likes him a lot!" While a pal of Joe's adds, "He always thought she was sexy. The more he gets to know her, the more he likes."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqonpmWerex0aCYq5ldn7ymecyapaCZnp6yrbjOZqeam5tivK95z52YZp%2BfYryvecOorJuklWKxosDEZqeim6Sqv6Z5kWlobWpjbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
