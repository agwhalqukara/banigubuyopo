PenaVega, 35, posted snaps of herself and Carlos soaking in a hot tub on board a ship, with the actress looking stunning in a blue bikini. "Two movies and a BTR summer tour laterâ€¦mom and dad are finally getting a well deserved break! Cheers on an insane 6 months my angel! We did it!! ðŸ™‚ #cruiselife," she captioned the post. Here's what PenaVega does to stay fit and strong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>PenaVega feels best on a low-carb diet. "What's really worked for us is we really love Keto and we were doing Keto for a couple of years, and it had just given us the most energy," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "We kind of try to avoid carbs anyway. So, we do everything in moderation â€” mainly a Keto diet where it's just proteins and good fats, but then we'll have trips where we just indulge."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_422513293.jpg><p><span>PenaVega has figured out exercises she can do anywhere. "For me, I'm all about squat jumps," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "Just get in front of your TV. Lift your arms up to give you that momentum and do as many as you can! Literally, the other day. I was on a mission to do a 1,000 squatsâ€¦and I did it! Set a goal because it's a lot easier. You'll give up way before if you don't actually set a goal."</span></p><p><span>PenaVega focuses on building strength over trying to be as thin as possible. "It's so easy to fall into the mind-set of, 'I've got to be skinny,' but that's stupid," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "You don't want to be skinny, you want to be fit! I think there's a huge difference and also being fit takes work," she said. "It takes an effort and to be able to show, 'You know what? I dedicated this time to improving myself every day,' like it gives yourself value. This is what I love â€” I think we have finally reached a really cool point in society where it's not about being skinny. For so long it was about being skinny. Now it's like, how can you be your best self? And for me, it's always about being strong."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_331039196.jpg><p><span>For PenaVega, perfect is the enemy of good when it comes to clean living. "I'm getting a lot of questions-slash-comments about people feeling kind of guilty about not going all-in with, like, a natural lifestyle," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "And, guys, look â€” if you can go all-in, that's amazing. But I think you go in as much as you can. For us, we try to stick with natural, cleaner products across the board, so that way when we go out to dinnerâ€¦we don't feel very guilty. For face products and stuff, I use very natural, clean face products. But then I do go and I get Botox because I feel better about my face after I get Botox. So there are little things that we all do."</span></p><p><span>PenaVega says she transformed her diet after having a baby. "Being a mom is a full-time job so I actually don't go to the gym to work out, I do it at home with Ocean," she says. "Basically, I hold him and I'll do squats and he loves it. Also cleaning while holding your baby in a pouch is a great workout. I would say I used to eat a lot more junk. Now that I'm breastfeeding, I'm trying to be more mindful of my diet. I love sugar and I've cut it out because I know it's not healthy for us."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKmty6WkmqqbYsC1rdFmmKWdqJZ6sbHNmq2en5Fitq950rCgpqulnsFuv8CyqmabmJqys7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
