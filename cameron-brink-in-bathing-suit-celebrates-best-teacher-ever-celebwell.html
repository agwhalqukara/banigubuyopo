Brink, 21, shared pictures of herself wearing a red and white checked bikini at the beach with Felter. She also posted a snap of the two of them wearing matching black wetsuits.

All that's needed is a basketball and space to move around. Her basketball core workout consists of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>the following moves</span></a><span>:</span></p><li aria-level=1><span>Crunches (30 seconds)</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Ball toe taps (30 seconds)</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Ball pass throughs (30 seconds)</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Ball twists (30 seconds)</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>Ball plank (30 seconds or until failure)</span></li><p><span>A typical breakfast for Brink consists of oatmeal, berries, and scrambled eggs. "There are many varieties of porridge oats, including rolled, quick and instant," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says registered dietitian Victoria Taylor</span></a><span>. "Regardless of the type, shape or size, all porridge oats are wholegrains and they all contain a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which can help lower your cholesterol level if you have 3g or more of it daily, as part of a healthy diet."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/pexels-iA¬üA¬±l-8641247.jpg><p><span>Brink loves coffee for both socializing and the energy boost. Coffee is shown to benefit athletes when it comes to their performance. "There is a lot of research to say that a moderate dose of caffeine, equivalent to around 3mg/kg body weight can improve a variety of sports such as endurance activities and high intensity sports," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>says Dr. Neil Clarke</span></a><span>, Principal Lecturer, School of Life Sciences, Coventry University. "There is also evidence to show that caffeine can reduce muscle pain during exercise and reduce perceived exertion during exercise."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/GettyImages-1443342918.jpg><p><span>Brink thrives under the right type of pressure, as it keeps her competitive and focused. "There's always pressure," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I'm good at putting more on myself. Even last year, I was so afraid to lose and I think that was the wrong kind of motivation. This year, I'm putting it into wanting to win and finding the right kind of pressure."</span></p><p><span>Brink is honest about struggling with mental health, and sees a therapist twice a week.</span><span> "Everyone has their way of coping," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I'm really good about being vulnerable. Whenever I'm in a bad mood or not having a good day, people around me will know. Mental health should be seen as hygiene, like brushing your teeth every day; you should be checking in with yourself, so I haven't been afraid to share that I've struggled mentally."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknJmdmr%2BwuoybqaKmm2K2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1knJ2cmq%2BzrdOeqmaalajBbsDEmpqhnaJisrex0Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
