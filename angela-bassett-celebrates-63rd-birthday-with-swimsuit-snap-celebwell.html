Read on to see 6 ways Angela Bassett stays in shape and the photos that prove they work—and to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span> 30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bikini Photos!</span></a></p><p><span>Angela is a fan of TRX training, which she does with Rob Thompson of Get Fit By Rob. "We start with low cardio — maybe run half a mile, then lift barbells while stepping up onto a bench and do a few machines," she told the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Los Angeles Times</span></a><span>. "I do a lot of cardio as well as strength building, and squeeze in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>medi</span></a><span>t</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>ation</span></a><span> when I can," she added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Prevention.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Bassett works out several times a week, and always with a trainer to hold herself accountable. "I will show up, 'cause I don't want to waste my money. So I gotta be accountable and know somebody's there waiting for me, because I know myself, and I will talk myself out of going," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>TV host Laila Muhammad</span></a><span>. "I go in the morning because my workout quotient will diminish as the day goes on. Maybe Monday, Tuesday, I'll do cardio; Wednesday, Thursday, because I'm eating protein, I'll do strength building; and then Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, when I'm eating all that fat, then it's about deep breathing, a massage, yoga."</span></p><p><span>Angela also holds herself accountable with working out via workout buddies. "When possible, I love to work out with my friends when I'm not on the road or filming," she told Prevention. "Recently, I got a couple of my girlfriends together and we walked the Rose Bowl. It's maybe a three-mile thing. It's about showing up and accountability," she added </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>BlackDoctor.org</span></a><span>. "You have to say, 'Everyone will meet at 8:15 a.m.' I know when I have a real plan then I'm there. If my friends are waiting, that puts a pressure on me not to disappoint them."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/GettyImages-1314420602.jpg><p><span>"I'm regimented and rigorous about what I'm eating. Diet is 85 percent of the whole thing for me," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Porter</span></a><span>. Her diet is incredibly specific, which she detailed in a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>video</span></a><span> from her Mission: Impossible Fallout press tour. "Monday, Tuesday, I may eat carbs, fruit; Tuesday, Wednesday, protein, veggies—veggies every day—no fats those four days, and then the last three days, I flood it with fat," she said. "Good fat, though: maybe coconut oil, salmon, almonds, almond butter, you know, olive oil, that sort of thing."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She also brings food to the set of her films, she revealed to the Times, adding that she plugs everything into her MyFitnessPal app. "I bring chicken and steamed broccoli or asparagus with me to the set — good lean protein, vegetables and salad," she said. "I just found this P28 [High] Protein Bread and I add tuna fish with yogurt, Dijon mustard, a little paprika and pepper, a couple olives and red bell pepper. It's protein with protein. So you've got a sandwich without feeling guiltyI don't do any dairy, all right?" During her press tour she revealed another one of her favorite bread alternatives. "I don't do any bread flour. I'll do Ezekiel bread, which is sprouted."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/shutterstock_795402238.jpg><p><span>Angela revealed to the Times that she does have a few guilty pleasures, specifically "red wine with chips. And cake."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/GettyImages-1198151889.jpg><p><span>Angela refuses to miss an annual checkup or health screening. "I lost my mother to heart disease as a result of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>type 2 diabetes</span></a><span> and only learned of the connection years later," Bassett told Prevention.com. "I have always been committed to practicing health and wellness, and now that I know and understand the link between type 2 diabetes and heart disease, as well as my family's history, it empowers me to maintain control of my health. For me, losing my mother was a wake-up call to start talking about the risk of heart disease with my family members who also have type 2 diabetes, like my uncle Ralph," she added.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkmqaXmrmiecGaqqydpKl6o7XRrZ%2BdmaliwLi1zKysoqxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
